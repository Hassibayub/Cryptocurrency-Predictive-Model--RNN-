# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

## A complete machine learning real world application walk-through using LSTM neural networks

### I will be going through a four step process to predict cryptocurrency prices:

- Getting real-time crptocurrency data.
- Prepare data for training and testing.
- Predict the price of crptocurrency using LSTM neural network.
- Visualize the prediction results.


## The Challenge
To forecast cryptocurrency prices using all the trading features like price, volume, open, high, low values present in the dataset.

- Close Price — It is the market close price for currency for that particular day.
- High Price — It is highest price of currency for the day.
- Low Price — It is the lowest price for currency for that day.
- Open Price — It is market open price for currency for that day.
- Volume — The volume of currency that is being in trade for that day.

## this is a complex time series based RNN model to predict the price of cryptocurrencies.


The Crypro prices that being predicted are:

- BCH-USD
- BTC-USD
- ETH-USD
- LTC-USD
